# Inconsistent Client-Side Navigation in Next.js

This repository demonstrates a bug where client-side navigation in Next.js using the Link component behaves inconsistently.  Sometimes it functions correctly (client-side navigation), and other times it unexpectedly triggers a full page reload.

## Bug Description

The issue is observed when navigating between pages using the Next.js Link component.  In some instances, the navigation occurs smoothly as expected, performing a client-side transition. However, in other cases, a full page reload occurs, resulting in a noticeable performance degradation and a less seamless user experience.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate between the Home page and the About page using the provided links.  Note the inconsistent behavior of the page transitions.

## Potential Causes

The root cause may be related to improper configuration of Next.js routing, conflicting JavaScript libraries, or an unexpected interaction with browser caching.

## Solution

The solution provided uses the `useRouter` hook for navigation, which ensures consistent client-side transitions regardless of the context.  See the `bugSolution.js` file for the corrected code.  This solution removes the dependency on the Link component for navigation, thereby eliminating the inconsistency.
